It's 2022 and I *finally* decided to try out Linux for the first time. Well, that's a partial truth. I had some exposure through some experimenting with a Raspberry Pi. Before however, I was mostly copy+pasting code snippets from tutorials.

Countless programming forums, blogs, and YouTubers praise Linux and the command line above all else. So I decided to try it out. Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) was easy enough to install, along with the latest version of Ubuntu.

My first thought was.. eurgh. How do people write scripts and programs in something so *ugly*. After some quick googling, I discovered that a lot of people use Zsh (Z-shell), rather than Bash which is the default shell on Ubuntu. After installing Zsh... I restarted WSL to find my command line just as ugly as before. More googling commenced. I discovered 'Oh My Zsh!' along with Powerlevel10k. After an hour-or-so of tinkering, my command line finally looked like somewhere I could work.

"You should totally use Vim!" said (almost) every Linux Redditor... and there my foray stopped. *I couldn't even figure out how to close the program...* 

My Linux journey continues.
